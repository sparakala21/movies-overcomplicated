This is my attempt at making a REST API for a app for two people.

List of movies goes into a storage system
so far we store the movies names and their tier. 
the front end should be able to query the storage system.

nice to haves: 
some way to 

what each request does:
GET requests : to get a recommendation(random?)
POST requests: to add movies
PUT requests: promote/demote a movie
DELETE requests: move a movie to the viewed category
PATCH requests: update a given movie
